# ECS
This is a small ECS I've been working on in C++. Currently, it is in a rather undocumented state. I will add detailed documentation soon.

## How to Use
Just copy and paste `ecs.hh` and `ecs_hooks.hh` into your project. `ecs_hooks.hh` has empty functions by default. You need a C++20-compatible compiler.
